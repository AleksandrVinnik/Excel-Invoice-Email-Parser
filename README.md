## 🔍 How It Works

Transform raw invoice data into a high-performing Facebook Lookalike Audience — powered by Python and Meta AI.

---

### 🧾 From Invoices to Audience Targeting

The process begins by extracting verified customer email addresses from invoice records using a Python-based tool. These emails represent a **source audience** — a high-intent group of real customers who have already completed a purchase.

Once uploaded to Facebook, **Meta’s machine learning algorithms** analyze over 1,000 behavioral and demographic data points per user.  

Meta then uses this data to find statistically similar users across its platforms, creating what’s called a **Lookalike Audience** — a powerful targeting segment that mirrors the most valuable customers not by interests or job titles, but by deep behavioral signals.

**The result?**  
Broader reach with pinpoint precision, higher conversion rates, and lower customer acquisition costs — ideal for scaling ad campaigns with AI assistance, not guesswork.

### 🎯 Audience Size Selection (1% vs. 10%)

Facebook allows advertisers to select the **size of their Lookalike Audience**, from **1% to 10%** of the total population in a target country:

- **1% Lookalike** includes users who are **most similar** to the source audience.  
- **10% Lookalike** offers **broader reach**, but with **lower similarity**.

### 👥 Visualizing the Similarity Spectrum

Imagine the difference between a **1% and 10% Lookalike Audience** as two groups of lookalike models on a runway:

- The **1% group** wears nearly identical outfits and accessories — mirroring the style, preferences, and behavior of the original customers down to the smallest details.  
- The **10% group** shares some similarities but includes a much more diverse crowd with varying clothes, habits, and behaviors.

This spectrum reflects a tradeoff:

- **1% = High precision** (best for ROI and laser-focused targeting)  
- **10% = Broad exposure** (best for scaling reach quickly)
